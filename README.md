# ML_Playground

A collection of machine learning and deep learning notebooks and experiments, built while following Udemy courses and self-study. This repo is my learning playground where I practice ML concepts, explore datasets, and implement models step by step.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `01-basics/` → Fundamental ML concepts (e.g., Linear Regression, feature scaling, train/test split).
* `02-python programming/` → Python programming concepts and exercises.
* More modules will be added as I progress through the course.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Python** (3.x)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Scikit-learn** – classical ML algorithms and utilities
* **NumPy / Pandas** – data manipulation & preprocessing
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Build a solid foundation in **Machine Learning**.
* Understand the difference between classical ML (Scikit-learn) and Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch).
* Gain hands-on experience with datasets, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

   cd ml_playground
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📌 Notes

* This repo is **work-in-progress** — I’ll keep updating it as I learn new concepts.
* It’s primarily for personal learning, but feel free to explore if you’re also learning ML.
